Are you interested about making a 12v powerful stereo amplifier circuit using a single sound IC? In this article, we will discuss the basics of creating a 12v stereo powerful amplifier circuit. To make this amplifier circuit, we will use several cheap electronics component.

The TDA7297 is a dual bridge amplifier designed for use in stereo amplifiers, car radios, and other audio applications. It can deliver up to 15 watts per channel into a 4-ohm load, or 10 watts per channel into an 8-ohm load.

The TDA7297 requires a few external components to operate, including power supply capacitors, input and output coupling capacitors, and resistors to set the gain. It can drive a variety of speakers, including 4-ohm and 8-ohm loads, and has a built-in mute function.


Component List -

To make this powerful amplifier circuit, we might need some electronics component. Those component lists have to been given below.

Component list -

There are several types of amplifier circuits, each with their own characteristics and applications. Here are some of the most common types of amplifier circuits:

1. Class A amplifier circuit

2.  Class B amplifier circuit

3.  Class AB amplifier circuit

4.  Class D amplifier circuit

5. Tube Amplifier

6. Operational Amplifier (op-amp) circuit


Pin out of Sound IC - 

To make this amplifier circuit we are using TDA-7297 sound IC and the IC contain 15 legs. These 15 legs have 15 different names. The pinout of this sound IC have to been given below.

1no leg - OUT 1+

2no leg -  OUT 1-

3no leg - VCC

4no leg - IN1

5no leg - N.C

6no leg - MUTE

7no leg - ST-BY

8no leg - PW-GND

9no leg - S-GND

10no leg - N.C

11no leg - N.C

12no leg - IN2

13no leg - VCC

14no leg - OUT2-

15no leg - OUT2+


Connect Capacitor with Circuit - 

To make this amplifier 1st we connect capacitor with the sound IC. The sound IC contains 15 legs. There are some common connections in these 15 legs. 1st We connect sound IC 3no leg with 13no leg, 4no leg with 5no leg, 6no leg with 7no leg, 8no leg with 9no leg and 11no leg with 12no leg.

Then connect 10µf/ 50v capacitor positive leg with 4no leg of IC and other 10µf/ 50v capacitor positive leg with 11no leg of sound IC.
Now connect 47µf/ 25v capacitor negative leg with 8no leg and it's positive leg with 7no leg of sound IC.


Connect Resistor with Circuit - 

This time we connect 47 KΩ resistor with the circuit. We connect this resistor with 6no and 13no leg of sound IC.


Connect sound speaker with Circuit -

For output audio, now we need to connect sound speaker with the amplifier circuit. We connect left side speaker with 1no and 2no leg of sound IC, then we connect right side speaker with 14no and 15no leg of sound IC.

We utilize JLCPCB https://jlcpcb.com/RTA to printout our PCB.


Connect Potentiometer with Circuit - 

To control audio, now we need to connect potentiometer with the circuit. We connect potentiometer ground leg with 9no leg of sound IC. Then connect potentiometer audio in left and right side leg with both 10µf/ 50v capacitor negative leg.


Connect Audio Jack with Circuit - 
For audio source now we need to connect audio input jack with the circuit. We connect audio jack ground cable with 8no leg of sound IC and audio source left and right side with audio Input leg of potentiometer.

Now we need to connect power source with the amplifier circuit.


Make Power Source (Step - 1)

To make this 12 power supply circuit, we are using 1N 4007rectifier diode. We connect two rectifier diode cathode terminals with anode terminal of 1000µf/ 25v capacitor. For power indicator we are using 5mm LED light.


Make Power Source (Step - 2)

Now we connect 5mm LED cathode terminal with anode terminal of rectifier diode. Then we connect 1k resistor with anode terminal of LED and resistor’s other terminal with cathode terminal of that rectifier diode.


Make Power Source (Step - 3)

For input voltage we are using 12.0.12v transformer. We connect this transformer secondary section 12v cable with anode terminal of rectifier diode and transformer (Ground) cable with cathode terminal of voltage regulating IC. Then connect a AC cable primary section of transformer and connect AC cable with (220 ac) voltage.


Connect Power Source with amplifier - 

This time we need to connect power source with the amplifier circuit. We connect power source positive cable with 3no leg sound IC and negative cable with 9no leg sound IC. 

Our amplifier circuit is now completely ready for use. Before use, we might need to use heat sink with the sound IC.


Soldering And Cleaning - 

Neat and perfect soldering is an important part for all kind of PCBs. Since soldering, you should remember that, there should not be any kind of short circuit connection. After soldering all leg, we cut-off the extra leg of all electronics component.

We also can use liquid PCB cleaner to clean the PCB board.


Final Action -

Our circuit is completely ready for use now. We need to power switch ON and connect audio source with audio input jack, just play music and enjoy the sound of this amplifier circuit.
